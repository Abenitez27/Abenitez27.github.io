# Welcome to my portfolio

This portfolio is a compilation of notebooks and scripts I created for data collecting, EDA, machine learning projects and anything I find interesting to work on and explore.

## Webscraping Projects:

### Crypto Currency app:

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Abenitez27/Abenitez27.github.io/master/gh_images/crypto_image.jpg" width="300" height="300">


This app is an interactive [crypto currency data visualizer](https://cryptocurrency-app-streamlit.herokuapp.com) using Heroku and Streamlit.
This app allows the user to see the top 100 crypto currency stocks currently from the website[CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com)
The main purpose of the app is to help the user see the price change of the crypto currency in a better visualized way using a barplot. The code can be found here [Crypto_currency_app](https://github.com/Abenitez27/Crypto_currency_app/blob/master/cryptocurrency-app.py)

**NOTE!!! Please give the application a minute to load as it takes Heroku a little bit to launch and webscrap the data when the script is run thanks!**

### NBA EDA app:

Here is the link to the interactive app on [Heroku](https://nba-eda-app-streamlit.herokuapp.com/) and Streamlit platform.
This application webscrapes data from the website [Basket Ball Reference](https://www.basketball-reference.com/) and puts the data into a pandas data frame. Streamlit allows for the interactive user input selection boxes to change the data according to the users needs. The code is here [NBA_EDA_app](https://github.com/Abenitez27/NBA_EDA_app)

**NOTE!!! Please give the application a minute to load as it takes Heroku a little bit to launch and webscrap the data when the script is run thanks!**

## SQL Projects:

### SQL Data Base Project:
This project was a final term assignment that utilizes Microsoft SQL Server Manager to import data from an [excel spreadsheet data set](https://github.com/Abenitez27/Abenitez27.github.io/blob/master/SQL_Projects/Full_Custom/sales_data_total_data.csv) found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/kyanyoga/sample-sales-data). The [Bulk Insert Script](https://github.com/Abenitez27/Abenitez27.github.io/blob/master/SQL_Projects/Full_Custom/Bulk_insert.sql)  inserts the data into a single table then creates a series of smaller tables to better organize the data in a database format creating Primary keys, Foreign keys, and special unique identifiers for specific tables. This makes the database much easier to navigate and query from for data reports and analysis. The [Queries Script](https://github.com/Abenitez27/Abenitez27.github.io/blob/master/SQL_Projects/Full_Custom/SQL_Queries.sql) is a simple compilation of queries that were used to showcase the database's table connections and uses. The [Term Project File](https://github.com/Abenitez27/Abenitez27.github.io/blob/master/SQL_Projects/Full_Custom/Benitez_Term_Project.docx) is a short word document describing what the scripts do with snap shots of the end results.

## Image Recognition Projects:

### CNN Model over the Cifar data set:

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Abenitez27/Abenitez27.github.io/master/gh_images/cifar-10_images_sample.png" width="300" height="300">
This project is over the CIFAR-10 data set that contain 10 image categories of:

- airplane
- automobile
- bird
- cat
- deer
- dog
- frog
- horse
- ship
- truck

The two Jupiter notebooks in this project repo [Cifar-TF2.0-CNN](https://github.com/Abenitez27/Cifar-TF2.0-CNN) require a GPU to build the CNN models for image classification. I recommend running the notebooks in Google Colab's free environment with tensorflow and keras and adding a GPU to the notebook. The two notebooks are over the same Cifar dataset but one is an improved version with an added data augmentation image generator from Keras. 


### CNN_Fashion_MNIST:

This notebooks is over the Fashion MNIST dataset building a CNN model to classify the images in Google Colab's free environment. The images consist of 10 different categories of
articles of clothing as follows:

- 0 T-shirt/top
- 1 Trouser
- 2 Pullover
- 3 Dress
- 4 Coat
- 5 Sandal
- 6 Shirt
- 7 Sneaker
- 8 Bag
- 9 Ankle boot

I recommend running the notebooks in Google Colab's free environment with tensorflow and keras and adding a GPU to the notebook. The code for the project can be found here [CNN_Fashion_MNIST](https://github.com/Abenitez27/CNN_Fashion_MNIST/blob/main/CNN_Fashion_MNIST.ipynb)

### MNIST10_Numbers

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Abenitez27/Abenitez27.github.io/master/gh_images/MNIST_dataset_sample.png" width="300" height="300">

This [notebook](https://github.com/Abenitez27/MNIST10_Numbers/blob/main/TF2_0_ANN_MNIST.ipynb) is over the MNIST dataset that contains hand written numbers form 0 to 9. The goal of the project is to correctly classify the images using an ANN model. This is done in Google Colab's free environemnt with the added GPU.
