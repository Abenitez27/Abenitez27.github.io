# Welcome to my portfolio

This portfolio is a compilation of notebooks and scripts I created for data collecting, EDA, machine learning projects and anything I find interesting to work on and explore.

## Stand Alone Projects:
### Webscraping:

This notebook [Zillow Webscraper](https://github.com/Abenitez27/Abenitez27.github.io/blob/master/notebooks/Simple_Webscraper_Zillow_Page.ipynb) is a simple web scraper I designed specifically for Zillow but could be modified for other similar listed format websites. The user inputs a Zillow search URL and the scraper downloads the HTML, parses the HTML, and formats the data into a pandas data frame for use. This web scraper is used only for academic purposes. 




### SQL Data Base Project:
This project was a final term assignment that utilizes Microsoft SQL Server Manager to import data from an [excel spreadsheet data set](https://github.com/Abenitez27/Abenitez27.github.io/blob/master/SQL_Projects/Full_Custom/sales_data_total_data.csv) found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/kyanyoga/sample-sales-data). The [Bulk Insert Script](https://github.com/Abenitez27/Abenitez27.github.io/blob/master/SQL_Projects/Full_Custom/Bulk_insert.sql)  inserts the data into a single table then creates a series of smaller tables to better organize the data in a database format creating Primary keys, Foreign keys, and special unique identifiers for specific tables. This makes the database much easier to navigate and query from for data reports and analysis. The [Queries Script](https://github.com/Abenitez27/Abenitez27.github.io/blob/master/SQL_Projects/Full_Custom/SQL_Queries.sql) is a simple compilation of queries that were used to showcase the database's table connections and uses. The [Term Project File](https://github.com/Abenitez27/Abenitez27.github.io/blob/master/SQL_Projects/Full_Custom/Benitez_Term_Project.docx) is a short word document describing what the scripts do with snap shots of the end results.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/Abenitez27/Abenitez27.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
