## Welcome to my portfolio

This portfolio is a compilation of notebooks and scripts I created for data collecting, EDA, machine learning projects and anything I find interesting to work on and explore.

# Stand Alone Projects:
## Webscraping:

This notebook [Zillow Webscraper](https://github.com/Abenitez27/Abenitez27.github.io/blob/master/notebooks/Simple_Webscraper_Zillow_Page.ipynb) is a simple web scraper I designed specifically for Zillow but could be modified for other similar listed format websites. The user inputs a Zillow search URL and the scraper downloads the HTML, parses the HTML and formats the data into a pandas dataframe for use. This web scraper is used only for academic purposes.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/Abenitez27/Abenitez27.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
